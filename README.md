# How to use

1. simply clone this repo or download the zip file to see.
2. You can view the output of this code by uploading to a server or using a program
   like [xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or [mamp](https://www.mamp.info/en/mac/). Both of these create
   a virtualization of a LAMP stack server. Allowing for local development. A must-have for any PHP Dev.

## Note:

You'll notice there is a .gitignore folder. This is meant to stop the sharing of certain files or directories. Here I
tell git to ignore my .idea folder so it's content won't change any of the settings in your PHPStorm.
